# django-demo-project
Basic repo setup with backend APIs exposed


# Run the repo
You can do the basic setup with following commands:

1. install Python and Django
2. command: "django-admin startproject <project_name>"
3. create super user to access django backend portal with "python manage.py createsuperuser"
4. migrate the basic database changes with "python manage.py migrate"
5. run the server with "python manage.py runserver"
6. open the localhost url + "/admin" --> it will take you to the admin portal

Do your changes accordingly!



Happy Coding!
